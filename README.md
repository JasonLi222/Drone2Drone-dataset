# Introduction
The proposed dataset primarily utilizes DJI UAVs (MAVIC, Air, Mini, Phantom) to capture mutual footage through various shooting techniques, including orbiting, fixed-point, and following. These methods allow for the collection of diverse UAV videos from multiple angles and distances, enriching the dataset with varied perspectives. Drone2Drone comprises 109,628 images from 50 video sequences with image resolutions of 1920×1080 and 2720×1530.
